This app is made as a POC of usage for Stream SDK. The goal was to develop a app with authentication system and autheticated user can start conversation with each other on a one to one or a group chat.

## Planned Feature

- Group Conversation
- Role Based User actions
- Create / Delete Group
- Start One to one Conversation
- User profile
- [More in pipeline]

### Current progress
Currently User can Sign up & Login to the App and can start conversation one to one manner. They can also create groups [Still no add member features]. Also user can search for each other and start conversation if they never talked before in the app.

### WishList Feature
- Give user more control over group feature.
- Give roles to user inside channels so that they can moderate groups.
- add/remove user from group if user is the admin of group.
